  title: Unifying Islands of Tractability for Maximum Independent Set
  speaker: Gunwoo Kim
  affiliation: KAIST / IBS DIMAG
  abstract: "The Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem is NP-complete and remains\
    \ so for every minor-closed graph class that includes all planar graphs (Garey\
    \ and Johnson [SIAM J. Appl. Math.'77]). On the other hand, due to the Grid Theorem\
    \ of Robertson and Seymour [JCTB'95], every minor-closed graph class that excludes\
    \ a planar graph has bounded treewidth, and MIS can be solved in polynomial time\
    \ on such graph classes. A drawback of this result is that such graph classes\
    \ are necessarily sparse. Since MIS can be efficiently solved on dense bipartite\
    \ graphs, there has been interest in extending the tractability of MIS to larger\
    \ graph classes. \nI will provide an overview of these attempts and introduce\
    \ a new parameter called *odd cycle packing (OCP-treewidth)*, which unifies the\
    \ tractability of MIS on the classes of bounded *odd cycle packing (OCP number)*\
    \ and bounded *bipartite treewidth*.\n\nThis is based on joint work with Mujin\
    \ Choi, Maximilian Gorsky, Caleb McFarland, Sebastian Wiederrecht."

  abstract: In this talk, I'll share a few of these thoughts, from research focus
    to future planning, in the hope that they resonate with others in similar stages.
    There won't be any magic answers, but maybe a few ideas that help make the uncertainty
    a bit more manageable.

  title: Approximation Algorithm for the Geometric Multimatching Problem
  speaker: Shinwoo An
  affiliation: POSTECH
  homepage: https://www.shinwooan.com/
  abstract: 'Matching is one of the most fundamental combinatorial objects in both
    graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Moreover, a lot of variants of have
    been studied in both exact and approximation settings. In the first part of my
    talk, I will present several classical graph matching algorithms and illustrate
    some intuitions and techniques behind them.


    Then I will focus on the geometric setting. Suppose we are given a set of points
    in a metric space, and we are asked to find a matching between them. Here, our
    underlying graph can be defined as a complete graph. This geometric matching problem
    provides both theoretical insights and real-world applications. In the second
    part of my talk, I will cover geometric variants of the aforementioned matching-like
    problems. This part shows that geometric tools can significantly improve the running
    time of the classical graph matching algorithms.'

  title: Linear-Time Computation of the Frobenius Normal Form for Symmetric Toeplitz
    Matrices via Graph-Theoretic Decomposition
  speaker: Homoon Ryu
  affiliation: Ajou University
  homepage: https://hmryu.com/
  abstract: 'We introduce a linear-time algorithm for computing the Frobenius normal
    form (FNF) of symmetric Toeplitz matrices by utilizing their inherent structural
    properties through a graph-theoretic approach. Previous results of the authors
    established that the FNF of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix is explicitly represented
    as a direct sum of symmetric irreducible Toeplitz matrices, each corresponding
    to connected components in an associated weighted Toeplitz graph. Conventional
    matrix decomposition algorithms, such as Storjohann''s method (1998), typically
    have cubic-time complexity. Moreover, standard graph component identification
    algorithms, such as breadth-first or depth-first search, operate linearly with
    respect to vertices and edges, translating to quadratic-time complexity solely
    in terms of vertices for dense graphs like weighted Toeplitz graphs. Our method
    uniquely leverages the structural regularities of weighted Toeplitz graphs, achieving
    linear-time complexity strictly with respect to vertices through two novel reductions:
    the $\alpha$-type reduction, which eliminates isolated vertices, and the $\beta$-type
    reduction, applying residue class contractions to achieve rapid structural simplifications
    while preserving component structure. These reductions facilitate an efficient
    recursive decomposition process that yields linear-time performance for both graph
    component identification and the resulting FNF computation. This work highlights
    how structured combinatorial representations can lead to significant computational
    gains in symbolic linear algebra.'

  title: Progress on Covering a Hexagon with Seven Unit Triangles
  speaker: Jeewon Kim
  affiliation: KAIST
  abstract: 'John Conway and Alexander Soifer showed that an equilateral triangle
    $T$ with side length $n + \epsilon$ can be covered using $n^2 + 2$ unit equilateral
    triangles. They also conjectured that using $n^2 + 1$ triangles is not enough.


    As a more approachable version of this problem, we ask: Can a regular hexagon
    with side length $1 + \epsilon$ be covered by just 7 unit equilateral triangles?
    This simplified question reflects core aspects of the Conway--Soifer conjecture.


    In this talk, I will present our progress on this problem, including our use of
    computer-assisted search and the insights it led to. This is joint work with Jineon
    Baek.'

  title: 'Capturing Additive Structures via Gowers Norms: From Arithmetic Progression
    Counts to Inverse Theorems'
  speaker: Jihyo Chae
  affiliation: Yonsei University
  homepage: https://sites.google.com/yonsei.ac.kr/jihyochae
  abstract: The Gowers uniformity norm has played a significant role in additive combinatorics
    as a measure of randomness associated with solution sets of certain linear configurations.
    In this talk, I introduce the notion of Gowers uniformity norms and demonstrate
    how they capture additive structures in a given set of integers. Gowers norms
    capture additive structures both through $k$-term arithmetic progression counts
    and through their connection to polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa via Gowers inverse theorems.
    I present applications of Gowers norms in both directions.
