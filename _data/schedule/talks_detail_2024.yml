  title: A postdoc life in Korea
  speaker: Semin Yoo
  affiliation: IBS DIMAG
  homepage: https://sites.google.com/site/seminmathematics/
  abstract: In this talk, I will talk about my experience of being a postdoc in Korea.
    In addition, I will discuss how the job process in Korea is going and share some
    useful advice to increase the possibility of getting a tenure-track job even though
    I have not made it yet.

  title: Colorful Intersections and Tverberg Partitions
  speaker: Dohyeon Lee
  affiliation: KAIST / IBS DIMAG
  homepage: https://www.mathloveguy.com/
  abstract: In this talk, I will introduce fundamental theorems in convexity problems
    of discrete geometry, including Radon's theorem, Tverberg's theorem, Carathéodory's
    theorem along Helly's theorem along with their colorful versions. I will cover
    some proofs and techniques such as linear dependency, Sarkaria's tensor product
    method, configuration space/test map scheme and discrete Morse theory. I will
    also discuss some transversal theorems, including our own result and the ideas
    of proof, if time permits.

  title: Transversal Hamilton paths and cycles of arbitrary orientations in tournaments
  speaker: Jaehyeon Seo
  affiliation: Yonsei University
  homepage: https://sites.google.com/yonsei.ac.kr/jseomath
  abstract: 'It is well-known that a tournament always contains a directed Hamilton
    path. Rosenfeld conjectured that if a tournament is sufficiently large, it contains
    a Hamilton path of any given orientation. This conjecture was approved by Thomason,
    and Havet and Thomassé completely resolved it by showing there are exactly three
    exceptions.


    We generalized this result into a transversal setting. Let $\mathbf{T} = \\{T_1,\dots,T_{n-1}\\}$
    be a collection of tournaments on a common vertex set $V$ of size $n$. We showed
    that if $n$ is sufficiently large, there is a Hamilton path on $V$ of any given
    orientation which is obtained by collecting exactly one arc from each $T_i$. Such
    a path is said to be *transversal*.


    It is also a folklore that a strongly connected tournament always contains a directed
    Hamilton cycle. Rosenfeld made a conjecture for arbitrarily oriented Hamilton
    cycles in tournaments as well, which was approved by Thomason (for sufficiently
    large tournaments) and Zein (by specifying all the exceptions). We also showed
    a transversal version of this result. Together with the aforementioned result,
    it extends our previous research, which is on transversal generalizations of existence
    of directed paths and cycles in tournaments.


    This is a joint work with Debsoumya Chakraborti, Jaehoon Kim, and Hyunwoo Lee.'

  title: How to determine a graph is Toeplitz?
  speaker: Homoon Ryu
  affiliation: Seoul National University
  homepage: https://hmryu.com/
  abstract: A given graph is called Toeplitz if it has the Toeplitz matrix as its
    adjacency matrix. I proposed a problem that how can we determine a given graph
    is a Toeplitz graph or not. For this purpose, I give a talk about Toeplitz graphs
    that might be related to this problem. Some simple observations and some previous
    results about Toeplitz graphs will be covered.
